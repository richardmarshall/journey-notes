Once through walk away from the cave entrance up the sand wall and up to the top of the main level cliff.\r\n* Over wind wall - Using the charge boost spot next to the glyph you can get enough height to go over the barrier.\r\n* Through sand falls - Using the charge boost spot next to the glyph you can fly through a hole in the top left area of the sand fall above.\r\n* Entrance side - Using the same charge boost spot you can fly over the barrier on the entrance side of the level as well. (https://youtu.be/0efbfKNe0yk)\r\n* RDS - It is possible to RDS along the ground and get high enough to fly straight over the barrier.

From there hop to the right onto the small pipe running towards the exit. Once close enough fly to the first large pipe running the other direction and walk to the left before flying out of the main level area.\r\n\r\n#### Fun sights (in bounds)\r\n\r\n* Larry / Garry - behind and to the right of the alter\r\n* Passive guardians - if you re-enter the main level after going BS and skipping the triggering of ??? the guardians will ignore you.\r\n* Top of alter tower - from the top of the alter tower you can see the HL art.\r\n\r\n#### Fun sights (in backstage)\r\n\r\n* Unactivated guardian - ?\r\n* Appearing pillars - ?\r\n\r\n### Tower\r\n\r\n#### Charge boost spots\r\n\r\n#### Backstage entrances\r\n\r\n#### Sights (in bounds)\r\n\r\n* Unactivated whale - above whale room\r\n* Flow creature #1 - In tower passage area with glyph\r\n* Flow creature #2 - In whale room\r\n\r\n#### Challenges\r\n\r\n* Dry climb - There are a number of possible routes these are just a few\r\n** Without dive boosting - \r\n** With dive boosting - \r\n* Dry climb as red - Tricky, requires dive boosting from various locations to land at glyph points for scarf recharge. From platform next to first glyph up to platform on wall with second glyph. From second glyph platform up to whale room. From whale room up to fabric bridge platforms. From last bridge section up to alter. (https://youtu.be/tNuCdkJolME) For a more difficult challenge it is possible to boost from the whale room through the tower passage with glyph for a recharge and again up and to the alter in one go removing the need to use the bridges. (https://youtu.be/Yt0iqCXJOgI)\r\n\r\n#### Short cuts\r\n\r\n* Dive boost dry climb - by dive boosting from various points along the way up the tower you can significantly reduce the time the level takes to complete.\r\n\r\n### Snow\r\n\r\n#### Charge boost spots\r\n\r\n#### Backstage entrances\r\n\r\n* \r\n\r\n#### Sights (in bounds)\r\n\r\n#### Sights (backstage)\r\n\r\n* Backside of heater - \r\n* Unactivated WM - \r\n* Unactivated flyers - \r\n* Not so distant flyer sprites - \r\n\r\n#### Short cuts (in bounds)\r\n\r\n* Skip to broken bridge - Directly to the left of the level start climb up the wall onto the roof of the entrance hall, then up the cliff to the right to a small flat snowy, up again to another small snowy area. From there fly to the right over towards the bridge. Once on the platform directly below the bridge simply fly straight up and onto it. You should be able to do all this before your scarf freezes too much. If you have problems on the first section you can go back into the entrance hall towards the gate and defrost.\r\n\r\n#### Short cuts (using backstage)\r\n\r\n* Skip to top of the death march - by going to the left past the WM you can skip fairly quickly all the way to the end of the level.\r\n\r\n### Paradise\r\n\r\n#### Shortcuts\r\n\r\n#### Charge boost spots\r\n\r\n#### Backstage entrances\r\n\r\n* Kelp - (https://youtu.be/_SVj9GaPhOQ)\r\n* Top pools - (https://youtu.be/HuKecYwixwU)\r\n\r\n#### Fun sights (in bounds)\r\n\r\n#### Fun sights (in backstage)\r\n\r\n* Null-zone - From final arch pool entrance fly to the edge of the lower pool side to land then fly back towards the mountain.
