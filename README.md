From second glyph platform up to whale room. From whale room up to fabric bridge platforms. From last bridge section up to alter. (https://youtu.be/tNuCdkJolME) For a more difficult challenge it is possible to boost from the whale room through the tower passage with glyph for a recharge and again up and to the alter in one go removing the need to use the bridges.
